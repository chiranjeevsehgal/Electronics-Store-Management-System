# Electronics-Store-Management-System

Functionalities:

Bill Management: The system allows to generate bills for customers purchases. It offers a range of functionalities, including the ability to create new bills, edit existing ones, delete bills when necessary, and search for specific bills for reference. Additionally, the system has a 'Retrieve Bill Details' feature, which allows to fetch bill details from a file.

Inventory Management: Employees should be able to manage the store's inventory through the system. This includes adding new products, updating product information (e.g., price, quantity), and removing products from stock when sold.

Discount Management: The system should support the addition and management of discounts on products. Discounts can be applied to individual items or as part of special promotions, and they should be reflected accurately in the bills.

Loyalty Management: Loyalty programs should be integrated into the system. Customers can earn loyalty points with their purchases, which can later be redeemed for discounts or special offers. The system should track and manage these loyalty points.

Employee Management: Store employee data, including names, positions, contact information, and access permissions, should be stored and managed within the system. Different levels of access should be granted based on employee roles.
