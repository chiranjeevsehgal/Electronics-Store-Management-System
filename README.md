# Electronics-Store-Management-System

Functionalities:

Bill Management: The system allows to generate bills for customers purchases. It offers a range of funcƟonaliƟes,
including the ability to create new bills, edit exisƟng ones, delete bills when necessary, and search for specific bills for
reference. AddiƟonally, the system has a 'Retrieve Bill Details' feature, which allows to fetch bill details from a file.

Inventory Management: Employees should be able to manage the store's inventory through the system. This
includes adding new products, updaƟng product informaƟon (e.g., price, quanƟty), and removing products from
stock when sold.

Discount Management: The system should support the addiƟon and management of discounts on products.
Discounts can be applied to individual items or as part of special promoƟons, and they should be reflected accurately
in the bills.

Loyalty Management: Loyalty programs should be integrated into the system. Customers can earn loyalty points
with their purchases, which can later be redeemed for discounts or special offers. The system should track and
manage these loyalty points.

Employee Management: Store employee data, including names, posiƟons, contact informaƟon, and access
permissions, should be stored and managed within the system. Different levels of access should be granted based on
employee roles.
